# BanditLoot
Bandit loot is a game that lets you win a new NFT by winning a battle with a random Bandit. Only transaction fees to be paid. 

## Extending Loot Project
To fight a battle you must own a Loot or mLoot [https://lootproject.com](https://lootproject.com).
If you win the battle, you win BanditLootGold and a BanditLoot NFT similar to mLoot. There are 1.3M BanditLoots. You can win one by winning a fight. 

## BanditLootGold coins
You win coins by winning a fight. You can use these coins to improve odds on winning another fight. More the coins, more the winning probability.

## Request to improve
I'm giving away 1ETH for the best game dynamics contract update.
